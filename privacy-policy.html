  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the FinSageX app (the "Application") created by Arpan Govila ("Service Provider")
      as a Free service. The app is provided "AS IS" and does not connect to any backend server.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data or transmit user information to any server. All data is
      stored locally within your device.</p>
    <p>We also collect crash data via Firebase Crashlytics to identify and
            fix issues.</p>
    <p>The Application requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To allow users to create and save backup files locally.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera & Gallery:</strong> To let users update their profile picture within the app.</li>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect data, there is no data retention on our side. All your information remains inside the app

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports. This helps us identify and fix bugs or issues to improve app performance and stability.</p>
    <p>Crash data may include technical information such as device type, OS version, and app state at the time of the crash. This data is non-personal and is not used to identify you.</p>
    <p>The data is processed by Google’s Firebase services, and by using the app, you agree to their privacy policy: <strong><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></strong></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored only on your device. We recommend using your device’s built-in security features to protect
